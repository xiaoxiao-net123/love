* Technical roadmap of my paper

During my master's degree, I devote much time to my research to investigate the rapid detection methods of carbamate pesticide residues in environmental water. My study attaches more importance to practical application based on the instruments developed in our laboratory, determining the total residue of carbamate pesticides in water by color reaction.

The research I am currently doing is mainly for practical applications. Although the experimental principle is relatively simple, there are relatively few references and studies available. My professor and I spent a long time to figure out the experimental methods. At present, I have completed the establishment of the research system, and subsequently, with the perfection of the experiment, I will also carry out patent application and thesis writing.

The long time of inorganic and organic experiments often compress my thinking time, but they also make me more determined and able to keep working well for a long time. Failure is the test I face every day, and problem solving has become a daily routine. But I still enjoy the process and it is a cool thing to keep trying and improving.

There was a time when I was very frustrated by the persistent failures, but the sense of belief in research and the expectation of application of research results made me regain my confidence and enthusiasm. Trust yourself and your own research! Hope this will work for you.
