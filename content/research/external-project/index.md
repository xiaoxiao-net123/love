* Slice of PE membrane
* Cleanup of PE membrane
* PE spiked by PRCs
* Package of PE membrane
* Mounting of PE membrane
* Extract of PE membrane
* Weight of PE membrane

Despite the large amount of organic solvent exposure, I have to say it is a cool process. I also fell in love with the smell of acetone. 

In the experiment, I seem to be an obsessive-compulsive person who must ensure the regularity of each piece of PE membrane to reduce the errors that exist during the experiment.

This phase also allowed me to develop good experimental recording habits, including experimental plans, experimental process records, experimental summaries, and weekly experimental summaries.
